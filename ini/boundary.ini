! In this file the mapping between input data for boundaries and transport species should be descrribed
! One list describes one mapping for specific set of input files. Name of the correct mapping list
! should be set in control file.
! Each list has the number of constrained substances and as many par_str lines as necessary to describe 
! the mapping. Each line should have the following fields:
! par_str = <boundary_species_subst_name> <boundary_species_mode> <transport_species_subst_name> <transport_species_mode> <factor>
! Factor is a multiplier for concentration in boundary file (fraction if one boundary species contributes to more 
! than one transport species etc.) There can be several lines for one boundary species and also for one transport species.
